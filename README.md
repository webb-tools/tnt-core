This repo contains interfaces and abstractions for using Tangle's restaking infrastructure for the creation of new
service blueprints. The service blueprint is a set of smart contracts that define the rules of the service and allow the gadget developer to customize the service to their needs, how it is used, how it is paid for, and how it is managed.
